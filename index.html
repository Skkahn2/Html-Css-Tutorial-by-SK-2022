<!--        MY NOTES          -->
<!-- 

   EXAMPLE: 
1) The car skeleton refers to HTML with the page body.
   When that skeleton is painted it the car gets CSS and after all that car is provided 
   with some functionalities like engine, etc (which refers to JavaScript), 
   the car gets life and can run.
   Similarly, when we develop our websites we need HTML for the structure and 
   if we want our website to look good and prettier
   we need CSS and if we want to add functionalities to our webpage we need JavaScript.

2) The stable version of HTML is 5.0 also known as HTML5

3) How does HTML Works?

 1:  HTML Document:

   HTML Document consists of two parts:

   1) Creation of Document
   2) Tags

 The first part is Document creation. This is created by choosing any text editor of our choice. 
 The choice depends upon which we want to write our HTML code. 


 2: Browser:

    A browser is an application that reads HTML documents and renders the webpage.
    They cannot read the content directly where it is stored. To settle this conflict servers are used.

 3: Rendered Page:

   This rendered page is the output screen of our HTML Document. 


 Basic website working:

    Web Browser(client) requests www.xyz.com like websites from the webserver.
    Webserver in return sends HTML, CSS, and JS files to that.
    HTML, JS, and CSS files are parsed by a web browser and show you that website.


4) How to inspect the HTML element?

   Sometimes we want to inspect the HTML element of someone’s website and to do 
   that there is a simple technique which is provided by windows.

    Go to that website.
    Click the right mouse button.
    Select the option Inspect.
    Now developer tool is opened on your screen.

5) What is an HTML tag?

   If you want to build a beautiful website. Tags will help you to do so.

   A tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags.
   Tags are words enclosed within < and > braces.

   Some of the tags are mentioned below:

    <html>

    <head>

    <title>

    <body>


6) HTML Elements
  
   What is an HTML Element?

   HTML Element is a combination of the start tag, content, and end tag.

   HTML Element = Start tag + Content + End tag 

   Nested HTML Element = One HTML element inside another HTML element

   For example:

   <h1><b> This is our first heading </b></h1>
   Empty HTML Element = Tags with no content

   For example:

   <br/>



 -->


 <!--            HTML BASIC TAG             -->

          </p>
